NEXT: Version 0.1.9:

- Fixed bug showing synopses invisible in outline view

- In title item, put synopsis to separate tab, and use scrollbox

- Added coverpage text field to title

- Inserting file: scene is named by file name

- Alt-X now creates empty Scene when used at bottom of content

- (PM) exclude .moerc from search path

- (UI) Context menu for index items

- Slightly improved RTF import

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.8:

- Corrected bug in Merge action (Alt-M)

- Synopses visibility defaults to false (index & draft views)

- Index has now popup menu, right side toolbar is now empty

- Corrected bug in Synopsis view

- (FIXED) There are some mysteries in "dirty" management: document
  seems to be dirty, but title is not updated

- (FIXED) There is something wrong in window size storing & retrieving

- (FIXED) Flattening does not short-cut when meeting non-included
  groups, instead choses scenes inside of them.

- Store synopsis/comments visibility to settings

- "Conflict" field removed from Scene items

- On fresh installation, store author name to settings when it is
  given first time. Same to website. This would need support from
  config subsystem side; function to tell in what "level" a setting
  is currently stored.

- Dialogs now use main window as parent (not in the center of the
  screen anymore)

- Improved FlatBuf usage. Now "Draft" shows synopsis + content,
  and "Outline" view uses FlatBuf.

- Some fine tuning to draft view:
  * Opening new file: author + title + content, but no index, synopsis
  * Edit draft: index + synopsis + content, but no author

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.7:

- (PM) Save UI settings

- (Merge & Split) Insert parts of different story to another
  one (like snippets)

- Dirty marking in Cont'd editing

- Saving in Contiguous View should work now

- .moerc: UI settings off from actual content

- Save view to settings

- Cont'd editing ToC

- Basics of Contiguous View:
  * Flattening text: creating contiguous buffer from chosen
    scenes.
  * Deflattening: getting the buffer, splitting scenes, and
    replacing content in buffers.

- When exporting RTF, opening the result automatically; maybe
  automatic reloading the document after changes?

- Replacing different quotes with '"' (when copy-pasting from
  different sources)

- Also, menu item to use texifier, and automatic open of results

- Always save (even non-dirty), to "fixate" character set replacements

- UI settings are not correctly restored: seems that window size
  works, but panel width does not

- Started preparations for first official file format

- Settings moved to .moerc/

- Searching: not working

- Texifier project statistics file changed from "STATS" to ".statistics"

- Older (pre-2.6) piping code (helpers.py) removed

- Removed TODO-field (from file format, and editor); field is ignored
  for backward compatibility

- Implemented "Synopses" view, hierarchial edit for synopses

- Tuned "Outline" view to concentrate on scenes

- Implemented special "New" view to quickly edit new documents.

- Removed '\r' when reading in file, to detect '\n\n' correctly

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.6:

- Default settings for author & website are now equal to ones used in
  texifier.

- Fixed config writing (checking existence of ./personal folder)

- Tested fresh install with texifier, no problems.

- Fixing problems with Windows (e.g. paths when launching, loading and
  saving)

- All the usual: fixing bugs, quirks and such.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3:

- Changed personal settings from ./moe/settings to ./personal, outside
  from moe directory tree. This allows (1) clean updates by removing
  moe directory, and (2) sharing settings with texifier.

- Author and website are now read from texifier setting files
  (personal/author.tex and personal/website.tex)

- All the usual: fixing bugs, quirks and such.
