MOE editor for writers
====================


*In English:* moe - let's say it's abbreviation from Markus' Own Editor - is a
text editor for fiction writers. Like the other similar editors, its main
features are:

* Dividing text to manageable chunks

* Storing metadata (synopses, etc)

Currently, it has no GUI localization and it supports only Finnish language.
It comes with project manager (moepm).

*For developers:* Even thought that GUI is mixed Finnish-English mess, code
is written in English (which is the reason for mixed language in GUI). If
you get interested to help me develop this editor further, let me know, and
I try to start to implement localizations.
